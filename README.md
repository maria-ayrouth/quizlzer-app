# quizlzer-app

to build the quizzler app we are using a API called the 'open trivia database' which contains over 3000 verified questions , which we can pick from randomly to fill into our quiz application .
by this app we 're able to keep track of our score and see the true/false question show up in the middle and then we can select true or flase.
